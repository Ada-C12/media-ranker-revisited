What did you need to configure and setup to make OAuth installed and work? | 1. get client ID & key from Github or whatever OAuth Provider I use. 2. Save that info in .env, and save .env in .gitignore. 3. add "omniauth" and "omniauth-github" gems in gemfile and $bundle install. 4. Change rails config to recognize and use omniauth & github, by making new file config/initializers/omniauth.rb. 5. Set up the github_login route and auth_callback routes, also logout route in config/routes.rb. 6. Go to Users_ctrller.rb and set up how to handle/process/store the info hash that github will be sending to auth_callback_path. (can refactor out dealing with the minutiae of hash fields in model/user.rb). 7. Make migrations to account for whatever new columns may be needed for users database. 8. Remember to code the session[:user_id] and flash[:whatever] in the User#create action.
What areas of Rails app code did you need to create/write/modify in order to change logging in to use OAuth? | I had to dump all the preexisting codes for Works#login() and Works#login_form because they no longer apply, also had to dump their associated routes in config/routes.rb
What was one controller test you updated? Why did you need to update it? | 
Why did we need to mock OAuth for testing? |
